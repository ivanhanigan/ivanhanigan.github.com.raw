title: About Me
---

I am a multidisciplinary data manager and analyst with over 15 years experience at seven Australian universities and the CSIRO, especially the ANU. I am currently a Data Scientist at the University of Canberra Health Research Institute. I am about to submit my PhD at the ANU.  Until 2013 I worked closely with Tony McMichael's Climate Change and Health programme at ANU. In 2014/15 I led the development of the data portal for the Long Term Ecological Research Network.  I work on data analysis that disentangles health effects of environmental changes from social factors. I give special attention to issues of data management, security, privacy and ethics, with my research into climate and mental health as a key motivating use-case.

I have primarily worked in environmental epidemiology, building on the systems approach I gained from my undergraduate training in human ecology at ANU.  My PhD research focused on reproducible research pipelines, integration of heterogeneous datasets and statistical modelling of exposure-response associations in the context of complex multifactorial causality.  My studies include phenomena such as the effects of drought and extreme heat on mental health. The conceptual framework I used for integrating these data incorporates the idea of five interacting 'capitals' and I explored the areas of differential vulnerability across sub-populations, precision of spatio-temporal exposure estimates and general issues of geospatial data analysis methods.

I have been both lead author and contributing author on 22 peer-reviewed journal papers. I have contributed to 6 reports and 14 conference presentations. My Scopus h-index is 11. My contributions have spanned the range from designing study protocols, creating datasets, conducting analyses and communicating results. The integration of gridded, point-source and area-based administrative data has become a speciality. In particular I have experience in the integration of health, social and environmental data which involves reconciling health and socio-economic or population data based on incompatible spatial units.  I also am adept at the creation of linked environmental exposure maps and computer programming. Alongside my experience in analysis of empirical data I have experience in scenario-based forecasting in climate change risk assessments.

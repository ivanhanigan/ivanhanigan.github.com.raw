- Today I chatted with Phil Kokic at CSIRO Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics about the way the spatially lagged neighbours variable absorbs any residual spatial correlation in the errors
- We agreed that this is a pretty minimal attempt, not as good as a spatial error model but pretty easy to implement
- I've hacked together some very very ugly code to construct the lagged variable
- [http://ivanhanigan.github.io/spatiotemporal-regression-models/#sec-3](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/spatiotemporal-regression-models/#sec-3)
- There may be errors, it's been a long day, but I won't have a chance to check back on this till next week so I thought I'd put it out there as is.

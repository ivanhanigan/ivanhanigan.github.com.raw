- The term Open Notebook Science[7] was first used in a blog post by Jean-Claude Bradley,

    says Jean-Claude Bradley an organic chemist at Drexel University in
    Philadelphia. As with most scientists, Bradley used to be very
    secretive. He kept his research under wraps until publication and
    frequently applied for patents on his work in nanotechnology and gene
    therapy.
    
    However, he asked himself a difficult question 5 years ago: Was his
    research having the kind of impact he would like? He had to conclude
    that the answer was “no,” and this was partly a consequence of the
    culture of secrecy that permeates research today. So Bradley was
    determined to be more open. Since his collaborators were not of the
    same mind, he severed his ties with them and, in 2005, he launched a
    web-based initiative called UsefulChem. As the name implies, the aim
    of the initiative was also to work in the world of useful science and,
    today, Bradley makes new anti-malarial compounds.

- Gantt Charts are a method used in Project Management to visualise the task list and progress with a calendar.
- The title of this post comes from [Dr Tomas Aragon's paper 'Project Management for Health Professionals'](http://berkeley.academia.edu/TomasAragon/Teaching/31679/Project_Management_for_Health_Professionals)
- There is also an accompanying [Tutorial](http://medepi.com/2012/02/05/project-mgmt/)
- Dr Aragon also has a couple of suggestions for software to use for creating Gantt Charts [on this page](http://medepi.com/2011/11/29/software-recs/)
- I haven't used those but here are some I have used

#### Gantter

- This is an online tool, that can integrate with Google Drive [http://www.gantter.com/](http://www.gantter.com/)
- It also imports MS Project files

#### Taskjuggler

- Emacs orgmode can be used with a Ruby package called Taskjuggler (tj3)
- The command C-c C-e j will export a file such as this description ready for conversion [http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-taskjuggler.html](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-taskjuggler.html)
- I also needed to include this suggested by d.tchin 29 Feb 2012,  [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/52844](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/52844)
- an example I use for a template is in my [disentangle Github repo](https://raw.github.com/ivanhanigan/disentangle/gh-pages/gantt-tj3/gantt-tj3.org)
- which produces [this output](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/disentangle/gantt-tj3/Gantt%20Chart.html)

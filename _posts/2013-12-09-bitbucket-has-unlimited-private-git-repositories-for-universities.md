- I just got introduced to bitbucket, an alternative to Github
- I've used Github for a couple of years and have been paying for extra private repositories 
- I did not realise that bitbucket worked with git too (I thought it was just for Mercurial)
- it offers unlimited public and private repository and unlimited users (to collaborate) if you have the Academic plan.
- when you sign up with your academic email address, [you automatically get an unlimited academic plan]( http://blog.bitbucket.org/2011/04/01/free-unlimited-user-source-code-hosting-for-university-students/)

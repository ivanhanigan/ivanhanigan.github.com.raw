This post is just a short note about something I'm thinking of calling "documentation-driven development".
It is based on the concept of ["test-driven development"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and more recently:

- ["test-driven analysis"](http://lamages.blogspot.in/2013/04/test-driven-analysis.html) 
- or even ["Evidence-based Data Analysis"](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/09/05/implementing-evidence-based-data-analysis-treading-a-new-path-for-reproducible-research-part-3/)).
- It is also a kind of a critique on the paradigm suggested by the BCCVL statement on ["Just-In-Time metadata"](http://bccvl.org.au/blog/2013/08/20/just-in-time-metadata/). 

Anyway, it is a small thing but hopefully big things will grow.

title: What Do Scientists Who Write Metadata Use To Do It? And Why?

- The extent to which scientists write metadata is probably lower than it ought to be
- The level of metadata written during science projects is probably described generally as 'bare-minimum' and "the minimum needed for one-self to come back to and understand what one did"
- It sometimes seems that even the bare minimum for one-self is not being kept very often
- I argue that the reasons for less-than-adequate metadata can be understood by looking at 
- 1) the culture of the scienctists displinary background via training
- 2) the tools available and 
- 3) institutional  requirements to produce metadata (both about data or access to data)
- In my ongoing [series of blog posts I am exploring the tools available](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/2013/10/two-main-types-of-data-documentation-workflow/).  
- In this post I just wanted to start the discussion about discipline culture and institutional requirements.

### Discipline Culture

- I trained in Geography in the age of GIS and this community uses metadata a lot
- Due to the prevalance of the digital map (collection of layers) which is a derivative data output
- Need to know the source of all the layers
- first law of GIS is "garbage in, garbage out" 
- I was trained in the ANSLIC standard from the start
- ArcGIS has a tool called ArcCatalog which makes metadata easy to create and view

### Institutional Requirements

- The ARC and NHMRC say they are going to require more metadata (and even data deposit)
- Restrictions on data access make it necessary to describe at least the metadata around provision agreements, licence, allowable access
- A supporting management level who value the metadata as research output (alongside a peer reviewed paper metadata pales in comparison)
- My old boss used to say "Work Not Published Is Work Not Done".

### This reminds me of Approaches and Barriers to Reproducible Research

- In 2011 BiostatMatt (Matt Shotwell) published [a survey of biostatisticians](http://biostatmatt.com/uploads/shotwell-interface-2011.pdf)
 VUMC Dept. of Biostatistics to assess:
- the prevalence of fully scripted data analyses
- the prevalence of literate programming practices

To assess the perceived barriers to reproducible research the also asked:

    What The biggest obstacle to always reproducibly scripting your work?

<p></p>


    | Barrier                                                  | Staff | Faculty |
    |----------------------------------------------------------+-------+---------|
    | No signifcant obstacles.                                 |     8 |      10 |
    | I havent learned how.                                    |     0 |       0 |
    | It takes more time.                                      |     7 |       7 |
    | It makes collaboration difficult (eg. file compatibility)|     4 |       2 |
    | The software I use doesnt facilitate reproducibility.    |     0 |       0 |
    | Its not always necessary for my work to be reproducible. |     2 |       0 |
    | Other                                                    |     2 |       1 |

### So what about the Approaches and Barriers to Me Writing Metadata?

With a sample size of one I asked myself these questions:


    | Q                                                  | A                                                                    |
    |----------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Do I fully document data (to a metadata standard?) | Occasionally, using DDI for high value raw inputs and final products |
    | Do I employ data documentation practices           | I use a tool I created to write minimal metadata occasionally        |
    | What are the main barriers?                        | takes more time, The software doesnt facilitate, not always necessary|

### Conclusions

- The tools need to help write metadata
- the Institution needs to require metadata
-

I've been trying to build pumilio bioacoustics server on a Aust Nectar Research Cloud VM, but hit various roadblocks.

- built with NeCTAR Ubuntu 12.04.2 (Precise) 
-  these issues (especially the apt-get install r-cran-mysql etc ) might not occure with later Ubuntu?
- test NeCTAR Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal) or
- NeCTAR Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring) ??
- TODO FIX issues with python audio lab
- TODO swapfile
- TODO Mount the larger storage 
- TODO add swapfile
- TODO fix R install etc

The Github code (in the gh-pages branch) and published as [a report at this link](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/pumilio-bushfm/).  The Source Code is available to Clone or Fork at [This Github Repo](https://github.com/ivanhanigan/pumilio-bushfm) and is at a stage that most of the installation and configuration is documented to a point where a test sound file has successfully been uploaded. 

#### HELP WANTED

- Any researcher at an Australia university could follow the instructions on their own Nectar Cloud VM.
- If anybody out there is interested in bioacoustics, R, Linux or web data archives please help 

#### Background to pumilio, bushfm and this project

- The [http://pumilio.sourceforge.net/](pumilio project) is by Luis J. Villanueva-Rivera and Bryan C. Pijanowski. (2012. Pumilio: A Web-Based Management System for Ecological Recordings. Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America 93: 71-81. doi: 10.1890/0012-9623-93.1.71)
- The [http://www.bush.fm/](Bush-fm project) aims to provide the research community with a portal to national scale acoustic sensor data repositories, and a suite of tools to perform analysis and reporting on these data.

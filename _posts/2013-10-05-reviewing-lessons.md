#### Introduction
This post is an attempt to put together a standard framework for reviewing lessons.  I've been to numerous workshops, master classes, tutorials and lectures and always take ad hoc notes that I generally re-write and re-organise afterwards.  I hope to develop a clearer methodology for reviewing what I learnt in each lesson.

#### Context

- When:
Either just the date and time or include more context like the broader event such as a conference, season, public holidays.  

- Who:
The presenter will give a bio at the start so make notes, especially to identify what disciplinary perspective they come from.

- Where:
Includes the address, city, lecture theatre.  These are cues for memory.

- Why:
Both why is the presenter here talking and also why am I hear listening.  It is important to critically reflect on what I want to get out of this lesson.

- What:
What is this lesson all about?  This might start with a synopsis overview and will probably move on to a sequence of notes as the presenter's narrative unfolds, and my thoughts on the topic evolve.  

#### Three Stages: Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis
A guiding principle I use for writing the 'What' section is the three stages: thesis, antithesis, synthesis.  I am not a philosopher so I don't know the proper use of these concepts in that discipline, but for me they are useful to structure my notes as I go through the process of a lesson.  Here is how I think of these stages:

- Thesis: 
This is where I might pick out the key topics that are being presented, and write down my prior knowledge and preconceptions about the topic.

- Antithesis:
What's the main message(s) of the presenter?  What are their priorities?  What secondary (surrogate) topics emerge around the main points?  If I bring questions to the lesson are they answered by the presenter?  If not why?

- Synthesis:
My new understanding of the topic.  

#### Other tools
Other things I use are:

- Mind maps: a central topic with a spiderweb of links extending out in a circle.
- TODO

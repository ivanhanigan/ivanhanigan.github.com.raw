I've been trying to build pumilio bioacoustics server on a Aust Nectar Research Cloud VM, but hit various roadblocks.

- issues with python audio lab
- issues with R packages install (and linux depends)
- configure pumilio to use the larger mounted storages

The Github code (in the gh-pages branch) and published as [a report at this link](https://github.com/ivanhanigan/pumilio-bushfm) is at a stage that most of the installation and configuration is documented to a point where a test sound file has successfully been uploaded. 

#### HELP WANTED

- Any researcher at an Australia university could follow the instructions on their own Nectar Cloud VM.
- If anybody out there is interested in bioacoustics, R, Linux or web data archives please help 

#### Background to pumilio, bushfm and this project

- The [http://pumilio.sourceforge.net/](pumilio project) is by Luis J. Villanueva-Rivera and Bryan C. Pijanowski. (2012. Pumilio: A Web-Based Management System for Ecological Recordings. Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America 93: 71-81. doi: 10.1890/0012-9623-93.1.71)
- The [http://www.bush.fm/](Bush-fm project) aims to provide the research community with a portal to national scale acoustic sensor data repositories, and a suite of tools to perform analysis and reporting on these data.

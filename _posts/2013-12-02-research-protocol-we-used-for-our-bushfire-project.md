- For a three year project on Bushfire smoke and Health we used the following structure in a wiki

#### Sections:
    A.Background        
    B.Proposals         
    C.Approvals         
    D.Budget    
    E.Datasets  
    F.Analysis  
    G.Literature        
    H.Communication     
    I.Correspondance    
    J.Meetings  
    K.Completion        
    ContactDetails      
    README
    TODO        

#### Conclusion
- it worked quite well in the first year.
- we didn't use it much after that.
- it is still on the ANU webserver.  I sometimes refer back to it now, a couple of years later.

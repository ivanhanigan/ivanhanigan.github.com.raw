- Git is a Distributed Version Control System.
- The [centerforopenscience.org](centerforopenscience.org) has developed the Open Science Framework  which is they say "a simplified front end to the powerful and popular version control system Git".
- I use Github a lot for extending the local features into an online space
- So I finally got around to poking the open science framework with the [Hutchinson Drought Index project](https://openscienceframework.org/project/pyts3/)
- It turns out to be too simplified, and not have very many of the feature I love about Git and GitHub :-(
- For eg it is not really distributed in that you don't get to sync your local repo with the onlin version
- you upload a script or dataset, then you continue editing locally until you want to commit and then you have to upload again, one file at a time with the GUI rather than "git add ." and "git push".
- I recommend having a look, it might work for you, but if you want more power checkout Yihui's suggestions for using github [http://yihui.name/en/2011/12/how-to-become-an-efficient-and-collaborative-r-programmer/](http://yihui.name/en/2011/12/how-to-become-an-efficient-and-collaborative-r-programmer/)

#### In general I don't think simple front-end's should be a barrier to accessing a sophisticated back-end!
